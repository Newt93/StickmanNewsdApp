# StickmanNews dApp
Private project currently a WIP created by Stickman & INFKT (Newt93)<br>
Will eventually let users read & rate news to earn $STCK which is an ERC-20 token that is<br>
currently being developed by INFKTdev (Newt93) <br>
It hopefully will prove that Flask can be viable for dApp development on $AVAX<br>
allowing for an easier path for beginners to get into dApp development without React.js & Solidity.

# Updates 
- Got the backend working / debugged <br>
- all Javascript works as intended or at least doesn't crash the Flask server <br>
- Bootstrap 5 CDNs are rendering <br>
- API calls are working
